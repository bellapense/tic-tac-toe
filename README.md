# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game built using `create-react-app`

## Rules:
- Game ends when a player wins or there is a tie
- When a game ends the result is displayed (winner is declared or tie is announced)
and the player(s) has the option to begin a new game
- A player's last move can be undone using the "undo" button. This feature is only
available if a game is still in progress (the last played move did not cause the game
 to end) and there is a move that can be undone.
 
## Notes:
 - Please ignore the slightly hacky CSS (negative margins and such, ugh), there
 was a time limit for this project and I didn't want to spend too much time:
